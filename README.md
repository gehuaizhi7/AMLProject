# Drug Recommendation based on LDA and Sentiment Analysis
## Introduction
With the advent of new drugs everyday, it is important to take into account the level of user satisfaction and the effectiveness of the drug. There are also popular websites such as WebMD where users provide feedback regarding the drug usage and effectiveness. We conducted two tasks on this final project. The first task is to build a CNN model predicting user rating based on drug reviews on UCI drug dataset (Gräßer et al., 2019) and predict ratings from reviews in the WebMD dataset (Harode, 2020). On the second task, we implemented a recommendation system that computes ranking matrix and cosine similarities based on their age, sex, conditions by using LDA recommendation system. We also take into account the rating scores we predicted on the first task to recommend top 10 drugs. The following image illustrates the whole procedure:
